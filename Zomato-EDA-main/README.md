# Zomato-EDA

Overview:

Zomato API Analysis is one of the most useful analysis for foodies who want to taste the best cuisines of every part of the world which lies in their budget. 
This analysis is also for those who want to find the value for money restaurants in various parts of the country for the cuisines. Additionally, this analysis caters 
the needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the country and which locality of that country serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants.

I really get fascinated by good quality food being served in the restaurants and would like to help community find the best cuisines around their area.
